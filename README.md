# LipSync Switch Input Module

**As of 2024-Feb-08, this version of the LipSync is now obsolete and has been replaced by the [LipSync 4](https://github.com/makersmakingchange/LipSync).** The LipSync 4 has 3 integrated switch ports for users who are unable to use sip and puff. Design files and documentation are maintained here for information only.

The LipSync Switch Input Module enables a user to use a [LipSync Classic](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/lipsync-classic/) with two assistive switches instead of the standard Sip and Puff mouthpiece. This can be a helpful adaptation for anyone who has difficulty forming their lips around the mouthpiece or generating the typical sips and puffs.

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Switch_Input_Module_BOM_v1.0.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Switch Input Module. The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. Make sure you order the correct splitter.


### 2. Print the 3D Printed Circuit Board

Print the 3D Printed Circuit Board. The [file](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/Switch_Input_3DPCB.stl) is in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/) folder.


### 3. Disassemble the LipSync, Assemble and Install the Module, and Reassemble the LipSync 

Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/Switch_Input_Module_Assembly_Guide_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to complete each portion.

### 4. Attach an appropriate splitter and two suitable assistive switches.

Attach two momentary assistive switches.

## Attribution

The LipSync Switch Input Module was designed by Neil Squire Society / Makers Making Change. The initial development of a 3D printable LipSync was supported by the Google Impact Challenge: Disabilities grant from Google.org. Further development was supported through the Government of Canada's Innovation Science and Economic Development Assistive Technology Program. These and other funders have also enabled Neil Squire / Makers Making Change to deploy numerous LipSyncs to users at reduced cost.
