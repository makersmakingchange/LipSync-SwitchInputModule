# LipSync Switch Input Module


The LipSync Switch Input Module enables a user to use a [LipSync](https://www.makersmakingchange.com/project/lipsync/) with two assistive switches instead of the standard Sip and Puff mouthpiece. This can be a helpful adaptation for anyone who has difficulty forming their lips around the mouthpiece or generating the typical sips and puffs.

## Getting Started

### 1. Order the Off-The-Shelf Components

The [Bill of Materials](/Documentation/Switch_Input_Module_BOM_v1.0.xlsx) lists all of the parts and components required to build the Simple Switch Tester. The electronic components may be available locally, but will probably need to be ordered online. Make sure you order the correct splitter.


### 2. Print the 3D Printed Circuit Board

Print the 3D Printed Circuit Board. The [file](/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files/Switch_Input_3DPCB.stl) is in the [/Build_Files/3D_Printing_Files](/Build_Files/3D_Printing/) folder.


### 3. Disassemble the LipSync, Assemble and Install the Module, and Reassemble the LipSync 

Reference the [assembly guide](/Documentation/Switch_Input_Module_Assembly_Guide_v1.0.pdf) for the tools and steps required to complete each portion.

### 4. Attach an appropriate splitter and two suitable assistive switches.

Attach two momentary assistive switches.
